#Youtube React/Redux App

###Overview
This was more of a learning experience forkign from Stephen Grider's excellent Udemy course.
The app uses React, Redux (not implemented yet), and YouTube's API to return real time debounced
search results. It uses webpack's dev server for hot reloading.

###How to Use
- Clone the repo
- Insert your YouTube API key in `./src/index.js` line 10
- Run `npm install` and then `npm run start` and the app will be live at `localhost:8080` (default)
